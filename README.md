# Super Mario Bros Remastered

## Description
A modern style 2D Mario platformer game with extra functionalities. Unlike the classical Mario games, this game focuses on merging RPG aspects into a fun 2D environment. Mario has much more abilities than his normal stomp attack. Defeat platforming challenges, solve puzzles, and fight enemies throughout the level. It is recommended to hit every speaker block you pass by (the blue blocks) as they give useful info on how to solve puzzles and progress with the game.
